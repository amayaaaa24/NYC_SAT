# SAT in New Your City

In this project, we analyzed data from the New York City Department of Education to explore the relationship between demographics and SAT scores. Here are our key findings:

1. Schools with a safe and respectful environment tend to have higher SAT scores.
2. The northern boroughs (Bronx, Manhattan, Queens) generally have higher average safety scores and SAT scores compared to the southern boroughs.
3. Schools with a higher percentage of white and Asian students have higher SAT scores, while those with more black and Hispanic students have lower scores.
4. Female students perform better on the SAT than male students.
5. Schools with a higher percentage of students taking AP exams tend to have higher SAT scores.
